## Calendar

### Lenthe

Lenthe encompases the totality of winter in Anthe. By relegating the long weeks to one month, the people can save their dread for only one month. Lenthe also contains all three of the single eclipses experienced during a year. While not as dangerous as double or triple eclipses, the single eclipses happen with more frequency. Eclipses coupled with the harshness of winter give many people the motivation they need to stay inside all winter. 

Important Dates: 

- The First, Commonsday: First day of winter coincides with the first day of Lenthe

- The Fifth, Queensday: The first single eclipse of the year

- The Fifteenth, Queensday: The second single eclipse of the year

- The Twentyfifth, Queensday: The third, and final, single eclipse of the year

- The Thirtyith, Queensday: The last day of winter, as well as the last day of Lenthe
