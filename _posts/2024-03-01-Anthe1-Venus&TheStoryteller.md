## Day One

We start with Lynore, Natalia, and The Painter, a group of students and an older art professor on the hunt for a flower for a special paint (an extra credit opportunity). The Painter, short rock gnome with lots of art supplies and a giant paintbrush, is intent on finding this flower, even at the cost of his students, however, he seems to be a bit lost. Luckily, Lynore, a tall, red tiefling cleric with cropped black hair and tall, vertical horns, spots a light and moves the carriage towards it. Natalia, a cat girl with bright red hair that’s part Tabaxi and part human with a blue cape, questions Lynore about what they’re heading towards. Lynore is a bit short with her and carries on sulking while driving the carriage. 

As they move towards the light, a cloud of mist appears and slices into Natalia. She feels blood dripping down her shoulder and is dragged away by figure with four legs, other limbs (and odd shape), and golden eyes. 

Aster, a tall, very pale man with light orange hair with purple flowers in it and a pink sweater (also eyes that are like pits) stumbles upon Natalia on the ground. Natalia questions if he knows what attacked her. Aster does not even know where they are and wants to follow them to a nearby town. 

We then cut to Azaki, a desert elf with dark skin, bleach-blond hair, and golden eyes. He loves his fiance very much and loves to overshare. He has his familiar, a desert fox named Rit, with him. They hear a scream and Azaki follows the Rit towards the scream. There is someone with a gold rapier and someone on the ground. The person on the ground asks whether we are going to help and gets up. They are wearing a uniform and they look strong. 

Aster is currently hiding behind a tree (not very successfully). He’s waiting for the group to leave so he can follow them to the nearest town or tavern. Natalia questions if he’s ok. (He’s not). 

The Painter is the only one trying to defend the group from the monsters. Aster, Natalia, and Lynore would rather just leave.

Aster and Lynore are attacked by the monsters. The fight begins and Azaki ends up trapped under the monster that attacked Lynore (he’s trying to diffuse the situation). The Painter paints an eagle that drags the monster off of Aster. Aster runs as far away as he possibly can and entangles the monster that attacked him in vines. Unfortunately, Azaki is trapped too. Natalia and Lynore kill the monsters rather quickly and one fo the fighters thanks the group and offers to pay for their food and rooms at a local tavern. Aster comes out of hiding for this and freaks the fighters out. 

They all get to the tavern, park the cart, and get some food. Natalia asks the person with the rapier (and a panflute) what their name is. They are called the Storyteller (the woman is named Venus). Natalia asks for a story and the players see an animation about Queen Cristobel of Soltus and a handsome prince from Myscian. 

They fell in love and had a child despite each of their arranged marriages. Required to be in hiding, they were happy until their families found them and their son. The son was killed, as he was never supposed to exist. Cristobel abandoned the prince and he was forced to mourn alone. He never returned to Myscian and was forever changed. Cristobel returned home, seemingly unchanged by her son’s death, and returned to a life of royal comfort. 

Lynore, the Storyteller, and Natalia discuss the story and what it means for current politics. Lynore reveals that she isn’t from Soltus, she’s from Myscian. She is forced to be here by her mother. Storyteller has their own reasons to hate Soltus. Lynore believes they are oppressive. Azaki does not enjoy their dislike of elves. 

The group heads to bed, with Lynore and Natalia in one room, Azaki by himself, and the Painter and Aster in the last room. Lynore and Natalia still don’t enjoy each other’s company. Natalie sets two spells to notify them if someone breaks in through the door or the window. The Painter paints an extra bed and a cat for Aster to pet. Aster is very impressed by his magic. They all go to sleep (as far as I know) and the first day ends.
