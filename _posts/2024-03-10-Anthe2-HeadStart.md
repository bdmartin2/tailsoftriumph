## Day Two

Aster and The Painter are the first to wake, with each one confused about the day’s plan and deciding on getting breakfast. Azaki has a similar idea and insists on making his own breakfast, only for a large tortle to kick him out of the kitchen. The breakfast is a crusty porridge, although Azaki uses his magic to improve his breakfast’s quality. 

As Natalia headed out for breakfast, she ran into Aster. They discussed whether Aster could create the flower they needed like he grew the vines. Aster says the vines are made in situations where they’re needed (life in danger). Natalia plans to use his fears so that Aster grows the flower out of necessity. To do this, they travel deep into the forest. 

Aster attempts to create the flower after seeing a painting of it that the Painter created. He is not successful as, for a few minutes, he crouches with his hands in the earth while the wind picks up. Natalia decides that Aster needs some encouragement and creates an illusion of drowning since Aster said that scared him. He felt very cold, almost as if he was buried, and there were screams. A deep voice demanded that he create the flower. The voice in Aster’s head comforts him and he passes out. Natalia drags him farther away from the tavern and heads back. 

Lynore, after eating her disgusting porridge, follows the Storyteller, insisting that they travel together to Myscian. She insists that she could help the Storyteller and explains that her father is in Myscian. She explains that they haven’t been in contact for 12 years. The Storyteller denies her company and insists that the parent who truly loves her is here in Soltus. 

On her way back to the tavern, Lynore finds Aster propped up against a tree. She attempts to find his pulse but his head falls off. Alarmed, Lynore reattaches his head with the scarf and drags him back to the tavern. 

Lynore bursts into the tavern, asking for help for this man who literally lost his head. Lynore uses spare the dying to help him and he gains consciousness. He is quite scared of the people surrounding him and accuses Natalia of doing something to him. Natalia insists that she used an illusion and he ran away. Aster is very insistent that he never ran, and whatever she did made him feel like he was dying. Lynore, Azaki, and Venus all see through Natalia’s half-truths and scold her for her recklessness. Aster insists that she communicate better. 

Venus insists that the party heads to her father’s home, showing her metal arm and proving that her father has experience in healing things beyond these students’ capabilities. The crew heads out with an extra horse on the cart thanks to the Painter. 

After a failed prank against Azaki, which only proves their romantic relationship further to him, Lynore and Natalia sense at least one creature nearby. Lynore sensing a “good” creature, but a wolf suddenly lunges at her, thankfully missing. Two other wolves are nearby and the team quickly disposes of them with the help of the Painter’s fireflies. 

Lynore scans for good and evil once again. It seems that the good creature she sensed was Aster. She tells Natalia and makes a mental note of this. 

After they all rest for the night, they arrive at Venus’s father’s purple and white mansion, surrounded by groves of apple trees.
